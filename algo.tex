\subsection{WORG Algorithm}
\label{algo}

The WORG algorithm has two fundemantal phases on each iteration:
estimation and simulation.  These are preceded by an initialization 
before the optimization loop. Additionally, each iteration decides 
which information from the previous simulations is worth keeping for the
next estimation. Furthermore, the method of estimating deployment 
schedules may be altered each iteration.  Listing \ref{worg-pseudo}
shows the WORG algorithm as Python pseudo-code. A detailed walk-through 
explination of this code will now be presented.

Begin by initializing three empty sequences $\vec{\Theta}$, $G$, and $D$.
Each element of these series represents deployment schedule $\Theta$, 
a production curve $g(t, \Theta)$, and a dynamic time warping history 
between the demand and production curves $d(f, g)$ as seen previously.
Importantly, $\vec{\Theta}$, $G$, and $D$ only contain values for
the relevant optimization window. For example, root finding algorithms
such as Newton's method and the bisection method have a lenght-2 window
since they use the $(s-1)^\mathrm{th}$ point and the $s^\mathrm{th}$ point
to compute the $(s+1)^\mathrm{th}$ point. Since a Gaussian process model is 
formed, any or all of the $s$ iteration information may be used. However, 
Allowing the time window to be either two or three depending on the 
circumstances balances the need to keep the points with the lowest $d$ 
values while pushing the model far from known regions with higher 
dinatnces. WORG effectively tries to have $D$ contain one high-value $d$
and one or two low valued $d$ at all iterations. 

To this end, $\vec{\Theta}$, $G$, and $D$ are initialized with two 
bounding cases. The first is to set the deployment schedule equal to the
lower bound of the number of deployments $M$.  Recall that this is 
usually $\mathbf{0}$ everywhere, unless a minimum number of facilities 
must be deployed at a specific point in time. Running a simulation with 
$M$ will then yeild a production curve $g(f, g)$ and the DTW distance to
this curve.  Note that just because the no facilites are deployed, the 
production curve need not be zero due to the initial conditions of the 
simulation, where existing facilities will continue to produce. 

Similarly, another simulation may be executed for the maximum possible
deployment schedule $N$. This will also provide information on the 
production over time and the distance to the demand curve. $M$ and $N$
form the first two simulations, and therefore the loop 
variable $s$ is set to two.

    # take only the most important and most recent schedules
    idx = argsort(D)[:Z]
    if D[-1] == max(D):
        idx.append(-1)

    G = [G[i] for i in idx]
    D = [D[i] for i in idx]
    s = (s + 1)

The omptimization loop may now be entered.  This loop has two conditions.
The first is that the next iteration occurs only if the last distnace
is greater than a threshold value $\mathrm{MAX\_D}$. The second is that 
the loop variable $s$ must be less than or equal the maximum number
of iteration $S$.
