\section{Performance \& Results}
\label{results}

To demonstrate the three variant WORG methods, an unconstrainted once 
through fuel cycle is modeled with the Cyclus simulator 
\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/HuffGCFMOSSW15}. In such a scenario, uranium
mining, enrichment, fuel fabrication, and storage all have effectively 
infinite capacities. The only meaningful constraints on the system are
how many light-water reactors (LWR) are built.

The base simulation begins with 100 reactors in 2016 that each produce
1 GWe, have an 18 month batch legnth with a one month reload time.
The initial fleet of LWRs retires evenly over the 40 years from 2016 to 
2056. All new reactors have 60 year life times.  The simulation itself 
follows 20 years from 2016 to 2035. This is the maximum \emph{in situ} time 
horizons expected, which may be 1, 5, 10, or 20 years.

The study here compares how WORG performs for 0\% (steady state), 1\%, 
and 2\% growth curves from an initial 90 GWe target. These are examined
using the three estimation variants.  Calling $r$ the growth rate as a 
fraction, the demand curve is thus,
\begin{equation}
\label{f-rate}
f(t) = 90 (1 + r)^t
\end{equation}
Moreover, the upper bound for the number of deployable facilities at 
each time is set to be the ceiling of ten times the total growth. 
That is, assuming ten facilities at most could be deployed in the first
year, increase the upper bound along with the growth rate.  This yields
the following expression for $N$.
\begin{equation}
\label{n-rate}
N(t) = \left\lceil 10 (1 + r)^t\right\rceil
\end{equation}
The lower bound for the number of deployed reactor is simply set to the 
zero vector, $M = \mathbf{0}$.  A maximum of 20 simulations are allowed.
This is because an \emph{in situ} method cannot afford many optimization 
iterations. The random seed for all optimizations was 424242.

Note that because of the integral nature of facility deployment, 
exactly matching a continous demand curve is not possible. Slight over- 
and under-prediction are expected for most points in time. Furthermore, 
it is unlikely that the initial facilities will match the demand curve 
themselves. If the intiial facilites do no meet the demand on their own, 
then the optimized deployment schedule is capable making up the difference.
However if the initial facilities produce more than the demand curve, 
the the optimizer is only capable of deploying zero facilities at relevant
times. This method does help make radical adjustments to accomodate 
problems with the initial conditions, such as when 50 GWe are demanded 
but 100 GWe are already being produced.

First, Figures \ref{deploy-0} - \ref{deploy-2}
show the optimized deployment schedule for the three estimation methods.
The figures represent the 0\%, 1\% and 2\% growth curves resepctively.
Figures \ref{deploy-0} \& \ref{deploy-1} show that the \stochastic method
has the highest number of facilities deployed at any single time. In the 
2\% case, the \allflag method predicts the largest number of facilites 
deployed.

More important than the deployment schedules themselves, however, are the
production curves that they illicit.
Figures \ref{demand-product-stochastic} - 
\ref{demand-product-all} display the
power production for the best-guess deployment schedule $G_1$ (solid lines),
production for the second best schedule $G_2$ (dotted lines), 
and demand curves (dashed) for 0\%, 1\%, and 2\% growth. 
Th figures show each estimation mechanism separately.

As seen in Figure \ref{demand-product-stochastic}, the \stochastic only 
estimations follow the trend line of the growth curve.  However, for only 
a few regions such as for 2\% growth between 2025 - 2030, does the 
production closely match the the demand.  The second best guess for the 
deployment schedule shows a relatively large degree of excentricity. This 
indicates that $G_2$ at the end of the optimization is there to show the 
Gaussian process model regions in the $\Theta$ option space that do not work. 

Alternatively the inner product search estimation can be seen in Figure 
\ref{demand-product-inner-product}. This method does a reasonable job of
predicting a steady state scenario at later times. However, the 1\% and 2\%
curves are largely under-predicted.  For the 2\% case, this is so severe
as to be considered wholly wrong. This situation arises because the 
\innerprod method can enter into deterministic traps where the same cycle
of deployment schedules is predicted for ever.  If this happens when the 
production curve is far from an optimum, the inner product method does not
yeild a sufficient guess of the deployment schedule.

However, combining the stochastic and inner product estimation methods limits
the weakness of each method. Figure \ref{demand-product-all} shows the 
production and demand information for the \allflag estimation. By inspection, 
this method produces production curves that match the demand much more 
closely. This is especially true for later times. Over-prediction 
discrepencies for early times come from the fact the initially deployed 
facilities (100 LWRs with 18 month cycles) does not precisely match an 
initial 90 GWe target. The problem was specified this way in order to show 
that resonable deployments are still selected even in slightly 
unreasonable sitations.

Still, the main purpose of the WORG algorithm is to converge as quickly as 
possible to a reasonable best-guess. The limitng factor is the number of 
predictive simulations which must be run. WORG will always execute 
at least three full simulations: the lower bound, the upper bound, and one
iteration of the optimization loop. A reasonable limit on the total number 
of simulations $S$ is 20.  For an \emph{in situ} calculator, it is unlikely
to want to compute more than this number of sub-simulations to predict 
the deployment schedule for the next 1, 5, 10, or 20 years. However, it 
may be possible to limit $S$ to significantly below 20 as well.

Figures \ref{converge-0per} - \ref{converge-2per} demonstrate a convergence 
study for the three 
different growth rates as a function of the number of simulations $s$.
These three figures demonstrate important properties of the WORG method.
The first is that the \allflag estimation method here consistently has
the lowest minimum dynamic time warping distance, and thus the best guess 
for the deployment schedule $\Theta$.  Furthermore, the \allflag curves
in these figures show that the best estimate consistenly switches
between the inner product search and stochastic search. These imply 
that together the \stochastic and \innerprod methods converge more quickly 
that the sum of their parts.  This is particularly visible in the 0\% growth
rate case seen in Figure \ref{converge-0per}.

Additionally, These convergence plots show that the majority of the 
$\Theta$ selection gains are made by $s=10$.  Simulations past ten may 
show differential imporvement for the \allflag method.  However, they 
do not tend to generate any measurable improvement for \stochastic or
\innerprod selection mechanisms. Furthermore, most of the gains for the 
\allflag method are realized by simulation five or six. Thus a reduction
by a factor of two to four in the number of simulations is available.
This equates directly to a like reduction in computational cost.

Figures \ref{converge-0per} - \ref{converge-2per} also show the tendancy of
the \innerprod method to become deterministically stuck when used on its own.
In all three cases, the \innerprod method resolves to a constant by 
simulation five or ten.  In the 1\%, this solution happens to be quite close
to the solution predicted by the \allflag method.  In the 0\% case, this
constant meaningfully distinct, but is still more akin to the \stochastic 
solution than the \allflag one.  In the 2\% case, the converged \innerprod
result has little to do with the \allflag prediction.  Thus it is not
recomended to use \innerprod on its own. While it may succeed, it is too 
risky because it may cease improving at the wrong place.

The \stochastic estimation method is also prone to simliar cyclic behavior.
The differnce between the stochastic and inner product searches, though,
is the second best guess is also in a constant prediction cycle for 
the \innerprod method.  With the stochastic search, the second best 
guess has more freedom to roam the option space, creating potentially 
different Gaussian process models with each iteration $s$.  Eventually, given 
enough guesses and enough iterations, teh stochastic model will break 
out of a local optimum to find perhaps a better global optimum elsewhere.
For the \emph{in situ} use case, though, eventual solution is not fast
enough.  The inner product search spans regions that the stochastic weighting
labeled as unlikely.  This assist is what enables the \allflag method
to be converge faster than the stochastic method on its own.  That said, 
if the \emph{in situ} use case is not relevant, the stochastic method on 
its own could be used without any algorithmic qualms.
