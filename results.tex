\section{Results \& Performance}
\label{results}

To demonstrate the three variant WORG methods, an unconstrained
once-through fuel cycle is modeled with the Cyclus simulator
\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/HuffGCFMOSSW15}. In such a scenario, uranium
mining, enrichment, fuel fabrication, and storage all have effectively
infinite capacities. The only meaningful constraints on the system are
how many light-water reactors (LWR) are
built.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/scopatz/fc-deploy-opt}
contains the relevant optimizer implementation and Cyclus input files.
The entry point for the implementation discussed in this paper is the
`cases.ipynb' notebook.}

When Cyclus is executed here, it is representative of the inner loop
evaluation of a deployment schedule guess, seen as the \texttt{run\_sim()}
call in Listing \ref{worg-pseudo}. When implementing WORG in fuel cycle
simulator \emph{in situ}, these Cyclus executions would be replaced by
a look ahead sub-simulation. For expediency in development of the WORG
algorithm, this work simply simulated the simulator.

The base simulation begins with 100 reactors in 2016 that each produce
1 GWe, have an 18 month batch length with a one month reload time.
The initial fleet of LWRs retires evenly over the 40 years from 2016 to
2056. All new reactors have 60 year life times.  The simulation itself
follows 20 years from 2016 to 2035. This is on the higher end of
\emph{in situ} time horizons expected, which presumably
will be in the neighborhood of 1, 5, 10, or 20 years.

The study here compares how WORG performs for 0\% (steady state), 1\%,
and 2\% growth curves from an initial 90 GWe target. These are examined
using the three estimation methods variants described in the previous section.
Calling $\rho$ the growth rate as a
fraction, the demand curve is thus,
\begin{equation}
\label{f-rate}
f(t) = 90 (1 + \rho)^t
\end{equation}
Moreover, the upper bound for the number of deployable facilities at
each time is set to be the ceiling of ten times the total growth.
That is, assuming ten facilities at most could be deployed in the first
year, increase the upper bound along with the growth rate.  This yields
the following expression for $N$.
\begin{equation}
\label{n-rate}
N(t) = \left\lceil 10 (1 + \rho)^t\right\rceil
\end{equation}
The lower bound for the number of deployed reactors is taken to be the
zero vector, $M = \mathbf{0}$.  A maximum of twenty simulations are allowed,
or $S = 20$.
This is because an \emph{in situ} method cannot afford many optimization
iterations. The random seed for all optimizations was 424242.

Note that because of the integral nature of facility deployment,
exactly matching a continuous demand curve is not possible in general.
Slight over- and under-prediction are expected for most points in time.
Furthermore,
it is unlikely that the initial facilities will match the demand curve
themselves. If the initial facilities do no meet the demand on their own,
then the optimized deployment schedule is capable making up the difference.
However if the initial facilities produce more than the demand curve,
the the optimizer is only capable of deploying zero facilities at these
times. The WORG method does not help make radical adjustments to
accommodate
problems with the initial conditions, such as when 50 GWe are demanded
but 100 GWe are already being produced.

First examine Figures \ref{deploy-0} - \ref{deploy-2} which
show the optimized deployment schedule for the three estimation methods.
The figures represent the 0\%, 1\% and 2\% growth curves respectively.
Figures \ref{deploy-0} \& \ref{deploy-1} show that the \stochastic method
has the highest number of facilities deployed at any single time. In the
2\% case, the \allflag method predicts the largest number of facilities
deployed.

More important than the deployment schedules themselves, however, are the
production curves that they elicit.
Figures \ref{demand-product-stochastic} -
\ref{demand-product-all} display the
power production for the best-guess deployment schedule $G_1$ (solid lines),
production for the second best schedule $G_2$ (dotted lines),
and demand curves (dashed lines) for 0\%, 1\%, and 2\% growth.
The figures show each estimation mechanism separately.

\end{figure}

As seen in Figure \ref{demand-product-stochastic}, the \stochastic only
estimations follow the trend line of the growth curve.  However, only for
a few regions such as for 2\% growth between 2025 - 2030, does the
production very closely match the the demand.  The second best guess for the
deployment schedule shows a relatively large degree of eccentricity. This
indicates that $G_2$ at the end of the optimization is there to show the
Gaussian process model regions in the $\Theta$ option space that do not work.

Alternatively the inner product search estimation can be seen in Figure
\ref{demand-product-inner-product}. This method does a reasonable job of
predicting a steady state scenario at later times. However, the 1\% and 2\%
curves are largely under-predicted.  For the 2\% case, this is so severe
as to be considered wholly wrong. This situation arises because the
\innerprod method can enter into deterministic traps where the same cycle
of deployment schedules is predicted forever.  If such a trap is fallen
into when the
production curve is far from an optimum, the inner product method does not
yield a sufficiently close guess of the deployment schedule.

However, combining the stochastic and inner product estimation methods limits
the weakness of each method. Figure \ref{demand-product-all} shows the
production and demand information for the \allflag estimation flag.
By inspection,
this method produces production curves that match the demand much more
closely. This is especially true for later times. Over-prediction
discrepancies for early times come from the fact the initially deployed
facilities (100 LWRs with 18 month cycles) does not precisely match an
initial 90 GWe target. The problem was specified this way in order to show
that reasonable deployments are still selected even in slightly
unreasonable situations.

With respect to the differences between the production and demand seen in
Figure \ref{demand-product-all}, if the decommissioning schedule is known
it is always possible to pick a deployment schedule that directly
compensates for the decommissions. However, the decommissioning schedule
cannot always be guaranteed. This is particularly true in agent-based
simulators where unforeseen decommissions may be triggered on any time step
or license extensions may be granted (and decommissioning avoided) at
run time.
WORG, in its general formulation here, does not take into account any
expected decommissioning information. This helps the methods generality
but may weaken its solution or increase the number of iterations
required.

Still, the main purpose of the WORG algorithm is to converge as quickly as
possible to a reasonable best-guess $\Theta$. The limiting factor is the
number of
predictive simulations which must be run. WORG will always execute
at least three full simulations: the lower bound, the upper bound, and one
iteration of the optimization loop. A reasonable limit on the total number
of simulations $S$ is 20.  For an \emph{in situ} calculator, it is unlikely
to want to compute more than this number of sub-simulations to predict
the deployment schedule for the next 1, 5, 10, or 20 years. However, it
may be possible to limit $S$ to significantly below 20 as well.

Figures \ref{converge-0per} - \ref{converge-2per} demonstrate a convergence
study for the three
different growth rates as a function of the number of simulations $s$.
These three figures demonstrate important properties of the WORG method.
The first is that the \allflag estimation method here consistently has
the lowest minimum dynamic time warping distance, and thus the best guess
for the deployment schedule $\Theta$.  Furthermore, the \allflag curves
in these figures show that the best estimation method consistently switches
between the inner product search and stochastic search. These imply
that together the \stochastic and \innerprod methods converge more quickly
that the sum of their parts.  This is particularly visible in the 0\% growth
rate case seen in Figure \ref{converge-0per}.

Additionally, These convergence plots show that the majority of the
$\Theta$ selection gains are made by $s=10$.  Simulations past ten may
show differential improvement for the \allflag method.  However, they
do not tend to generate any measurable improvement for \stochastic or
\innerprod selection mechanisms. Furthermore, most of the gains for the
\allflag method are realized by simulation five or six. Thus a reduction
by a factor of two to four in the number of simulations is available.
This equates directly to a like reduction in computational cost.

Moreover,
Figures \ref{converge-0per} - \ref{converge-2per} also show the tendency of
the \innerprod method to become deterministically stuck when used on its own.
In all three cases the \innerprod method resolves to a constant by
simulation five or ten.  In the 1\% case, this solution happens to be quite close
to the solution predicted by the \allflag method.  In the 0\% case, this
constant is meaningfully distinct, but is still more akin to the \stochastic
solution than the \allflag solution.  In the 2\% case, the converged \innerprod
result has little to do with the \allflag prediction.  Thus it is not
recommended to use \innerprod on its own. While it may succeed, it is too
risky because it may cease improving at the wrong place.

The \stochastic estimation method is also prone to similar cyclic behavior.
However, in the \innerprod method,
is the second best guess $G_2$ is also in a constant prediction cycle along
with $G_1$.  With the stochastic search, the second best
guess has more freedom to roam the option space, creating potentially
different Gaussian process models with each iteration $s$.  Eventually, given
enough guesses and enough iterations, the stochastic model will break
out of a local optimum to perhaps find a better global optimum elsewhere.
For the \emph{in situ} use case, though, eventual solution is not fast
enough.  The inner product search spans regions that the stochastic weighting
labeled as unlikely.  This assist is what enables the \allflag method
to converge faster than the stochastic method on its own.  That said,
if the \emph{in situ} use case is not relevant, the stochastic method on
its own could be used without any algorithmic qualms.
