A method for quickly determining deployment schedules that meet a given 
fuel cycle demand is presented here. This algorithm is fast enough to 
perform \emph{in situ} in low-fidelity fuel cycle simulators. It uses
Gaussian process regression models to predict the production curve as a 
function of time and the number of deployed facilities. Each of these
predictions is measured against the demand curve using the dynamic time
warping distance. The minimum distance deployment schedule is evaluated
in a full fuel cycle simulation, whose generated production curve 
then informs the model on the next optimization iteration. The method
converges within five to ten iterations to a distance that is less than one 
percent of the total deployable production. A representative once-through
fuel cycle is used to demonstrate the methodology for reactor deployment.
