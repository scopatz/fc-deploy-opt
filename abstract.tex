A method for quickly determining deployment schedules that meet any given
fuel cycle demands is presented here. This algorithm is fast enough to
perform \emph{in situ} within low-fidelity fuel cycle simulators. It uses
Gaussian process regression models to predict the production curve as a
function of time and the number of deployed facilities. Each of these
predictions is measured against the demand curve using the dynamic time
warping distance. The minimum distance deployment schedule is evaluated
in a full fuel cycle simulation, whose generated production curve
then informs the model on the next optimization iteration. The method
converges within five to ten iterations to a distance that is less than one
percent of the total deployable production. A representative once-through
fuel cycle is used to demonstrate the methodology for reactor deployment.
However, the algorithm itself is multivariate and maybe used to determine
deployment schedules of many facilities types that meet a number of
independent criteria simultaneously. The once-through, electricity production
example was chosen for the simplicity of illustrating the method.
