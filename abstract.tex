A method for quickly determining deployment schedules that meet a given 
fuel cycle demand is presented here. This algorithm is fast enough to 
perform \emph{in situ} in low-fidelity fuel cycle simulators. It uses
Gaussian process regression models to predict the prodcution curve as a 
function of time and the number of deployed facilites. The each of these
predictions is measured against the demand curve using the dynamic time
warping distance. The minium distance deployment schedule is evaluated
in a full fuel cycle simulation, whose generated prodcution curve 
then informs the model on the next optimization iteration. The method
converges with five to ten iterations to a total distance less than one 
percent of the total deployable production. A representative once-through
fuel cycle is used to demonstrtate the methodology.
