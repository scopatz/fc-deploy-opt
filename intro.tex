\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

With the recent advent of agent-based nuclear fuel cycle simulators, such as 
Cyclus \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/HuffGCFMOSSW15,cyclus_v1_0}, there comes the 
possibility to make \emph{in situ} facility deployment decisions. This 
agency would more fully model real-world fuel cycles, where institutions
predict future demand and choose their future deployment schedules 
approriately. However, one of the major challenges to making \emph{in situ}
deployment decisions is the speed at which ``good enough'' decisions can 
be made. This paper proposes three related deployment-specific optimization 
algorithims that can be used for any facility type.

The demands of a fuel cycle scenario can often be simply stated, e.g. 
1\% growth in power production [GWe]. Picking a deployment schedule for a 
certain kind of facility (e.g. reactors) can thus be seen as an optimization 
problem of how well the deployment schedule meets the demand. Here, the 
dynamic time warping (DTW) \cite{muller} distance is minimized 
between the demand curve and the regression of a Gaussian Process model (GP) 
\cite{rasmussen2006gaussian} of prior simulations. This minimization produces
a guess for a deployment schedule which is subsequently tested using 
the actual simulator. This process is repeated until an optimal deployment
schedule for the given demand is found.

Importantly, by using the Gaussian process surrogates, the number of 
simulation realizations that must be executed as part of the optimization is 
reduced to only a handful. Furthermore, it is at least two 
orders-of-magnitude faster to test the model than it is to run a single
low-fidelity fuel cycle simulation. Because of the realtive cheapness, it 
is suitable to be used inside of a fuel cycle simulation. Traditional
\emph{ex situ} optimizers may be able to find more precise solutions but at a
computational cost beyond the scope and need of an \emph{in situ} use case.

Every iteration of warp optimization of regressed Gaussian processes (WORG) 
method described here has two phases. The first is an esitmation phase where 
the Gaussian process model is built and evaluated. The second takes the 
deployment schedule from the estimation phase and run it in a fuel cycle 
simulator. The results of the simulator of the $s$-th iteration are then 
used to inform the model on the $(s+1)$-th iteration. 

Inside of each estimation phase there are three possible strategies for 
chosing the next deployment schedule.  The first is to sample of the 
space of all possible deployment strategies stochatically and then take the 
best guess.  The second is to search through the inner product of all choices,
picking the best option for each deployment parameter. The third option 
is to perform the previous two strategies and determine which one picked
has the better guess.
